          For this project the owners wanted a more modern look to their website, so I got re-designing Golfhandelen.no to a more user-friendly e-commerce golf website. I conducted a comparative analysis where I listed positive and the negative features of other golf websites. 
            With this information I could gather features and looks that I wanted to implement to the new website. I was also in order of creating new banners
            for the website.

          <p class="breadcrumbs">
            I started out with looking at other golf websites to look at their structures, as I am not really familiar with
            golf website structures. After that I sketched a lo-fi prototype and continued with the hi-fi prototype in Figma. We forwarded the prototype
and we later on started to implement small pieces of the design to the e-commerce website. In the meantime I also created photo banners for the website
using Illustrator and Photoshop.

<h2 class="projectHeadline">Lessons</h2>
            <p class="breadcrumbs">
             Being introduced to Golfhandelens e-commerce platform: Askås, we quickly realized we were limited with the visual design and the UI-design that was created.
            Although we were limited, we tried our best to implement some parts of the UI-design that was created in Figma. It was a learning curve that it is not always possible that the design will turn 
out as you would want it to. What is important though, is that our customer was happy with the design and made it easier for their customers to buy their equipments. I was and am also in charge of re-making their banners (for website and also Facebook page) and visual aspects to fit their new design, using Illustrator and Photoshop.
